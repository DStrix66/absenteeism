# Absenteeism Project

*PURPOSE*: To support HR decision-making on cost reduction and employee job satisfaction by identifying the main predictors of excessive absenteeism at work.

*AIM*: To predict excessive absenteeism at work (>= 3 hours absence during work hours) based on historical absenteeism data.

*METHOD*: Use Python for EDA and feature engineering to prepare data to be fed into a pre-built regression ML model and visualise insights in Tableau Public.

*DATA*: Primary raw data provided by company's HR department.

Markups are given in the two Jupyter notebooks -- "Predict Absenteeism Project Part I.ipynb" and "Predict Absenteeism Project Part II.ipynb" -- in which
the project is carried out. Each step is numbered and provided a markup so you can follow along with the exploratory analysis, cleanup, and creation of
dummy variables. The visualisation can be accessed through this link:

This is one of my first projects, so please let me know what you think and if you have any suggestions.
